# PSD2020
This is based off of the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) course and models the website on [Render](https://render.com)

The link for the website is:

This currently supports prediction of either Carrots or Turnips, but I will probably expand it before PSD2020.
I want to bring a bunch of vegetables, then have the kids take pictures of them. 
They can then upload the images, and see what the computer thinks it is.
